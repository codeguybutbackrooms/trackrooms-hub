# Trackrooms Hub
This is my own hack!!

Loadstring:
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codeguybutbackrooms/trackrooms-hub/main/versions/0.1.8-shortened.lua'))()
```
If you want experience the best draft version (or some of beta features in the future) <br>
(help this is the fifth draft of 0.1.9 version and it still bug)
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codeguybutbackrooms/trackrooms-hub/main/versions/drafts/test-beta-0.1.9-5.lua'))()
```
